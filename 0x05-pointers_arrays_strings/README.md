Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

Return value: the pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcpy. Run man strcpy to learn more.
